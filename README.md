LSDTopoTools Hillslope Analysis Tools from Grieve et al 2015
================================================

This folder contains source code for the hillslope analysis tools described in a pair of papers which will shortly be released in ESurfD and ESPL. This code provides the tools to generate hillslope length data and dimensionless erosion rate and relief (E\*R\*) plots.

This code is part of the [LSDTopoTools software package](http://lsdtopotools.github.io/).

The versions here are updated on a semi regular basis. 

For instructions, go to the [LSDTopoTools documentation website](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~smudd/LSDTT_book/LSDTT_docs.html) and download the raw data for the ESPL paper [here](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s0675405/LH_Data/LH_Data.zip) and the ESurfD paper [here](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s0675405/ER_Data/ER_Data.zip).
